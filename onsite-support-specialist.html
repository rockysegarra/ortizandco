                        <p><strong>Benefits of having an event Onsite Support Specialist</strong></p>
                        <p>
After you plan the perfect event, the last thing you want is for your attendees to be disappointed or have a less-than-perfect time. Let alone walk away and tell others what their experience was like.</p>

<p>We at Ortiz & Co. understand the amount of time, money, and effort that go into a successful event, from pre-planning all the way up to event day. Ensuring the event runs smoothly once you're on-site is a huge undertaking, and this is where an onsite Event Support Specialist can help.

                        </p>
                        <p><strong>What is an Onsite Support Specialist?</strong></p>
                        <p>
            
                          
                          An Onsite Specialist is a behind-the-scenes second member of your team, but their job functions are confined to supporting your onsite needs and managing and executing all minor details, allowing you to focus on your more important tasks.
                          
                        </p>
                        <p><strong>An Onsite Specialist can support the following areas:</strong></p>
